## Why create another Nostr Client?

I simply wish to make the best client for myself. I am committed to making this entire project open source and free using a Creative Commons license. I will be deploying this client myself on my own hosting, but hope that anyone who likes it feels free to host their client using this code. Nostr is meant to be for everyone so I hope this code assures that it remains that way.

I look forward to hearing any feedback on this client and will incorporate any ideas I like and find useful.

# Angular Deployment Instructions

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4. It is designed to a client UI interface for the Nostr protocol.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
