## Why create another Nostr Client?

I simply wish to make the best client for myself. I am committed to making this entire project open source and free using a Creative Commons license. I will be deploying this client myself on my own hosting, but hope that anyone who likes it feels free to host their client using this code. Nostr is meant to be for everyone so I hope this code assures that it remains that way.

I look forward to hearing any feedback on this client and will incorporate any ideas I like and find useful.
